# Fraudulent Job Posting Prediction 
 
This is my final project for the course CS 334/EE 402 - Principle and Techniques of Data Science offered in Spring 2024 at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. This project was supervised by the course instructor Dr. Mobin Javed (Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, LUMS).

## Introduction
The purpose of this endeavor is to gain hands-on experience with all stages of a data science project. This involves formulating questions to investigate, selecting appropriate datasets, evaluating data quality, performing data cleaning, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). Additionally, interesting conclusions will be drawn from the data, and effective models are expected to be developed.

For this project, I used the [Real/Fake Job Posting Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction) dataset from Kaggle. More can be found out about my project by reading the very interesting [blog post](https://faiziali.medium.com/predicting-fraudulent-job-postings-af0056251533) that I wrote on Medium on this topic.
